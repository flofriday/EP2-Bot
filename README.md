# EP2-Bot
A bot for "Einführung in die Programmierung 2" TU Vienna


At TU Vienna we get a git repository for "Einführung in die Programmierung 2" (Introduction to Programming 2). All of our assignments will get to us via that git repo and also our points.

While git is amazing I would love that data without needing to log in every time. So for that reason this bot will craw the git repo every now and then and tell me whenever a new assignment/point review is out.

At the moment this repo is only a placeholder because I haven't got any assignments yet.
